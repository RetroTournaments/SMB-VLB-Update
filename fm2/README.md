# FM2
This folder contains all of the FM2 files for all of the recreated sub-five Super Mario Bros. speedruns.
You can read more about the [FM2 format here](https://fceux.com/web/FM2.html).

The only sort of strange thing we do is to add a comment which indicates the 'offset' in milliseconds when comparing the fm2 with the extracted video.
This comment is automatically maintained by Graphite, and does not need to be edited by hand.

## Setup
In order to extract all of the files you can run

```
tar -zxvf *.tar.gz
```

The raw .fm2 files are not tracked because they are quite disk-space inefficient.
